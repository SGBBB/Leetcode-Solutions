yar kuch khass ni saare bits ko vertically khara krdo
​
then ap until 32 tak saare bits ka sum nikalo for every number
if your sum is divisible by 3 that means ki apka single occuring number ka current bit 0 hoga else vo bit 1 hoga (becoz 3 times already present h then abhi 1 extra bit lga di gayi h ).
